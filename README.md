This is a project that allows Windows users to fetch a random background from their specified list of albums and make it their background on their desktop. This is the initial commit of this project.

Currently getting details on if it is allowed to make the client-id publicly viewable for the Imgur API, once that is known a better README will be in place for your viewing pleasure. Once that is done I will make the information publicly available so that others can use this set of scripts on pull.
